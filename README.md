### Summary

I have developed the small project which has list of albums with there corresponding users and images in it, the album have detail of user and images which will be shown if user clicks on any album, the project also has user filter option which will filter out list of albums based on selected user

### Design Decisions

I have used components to develop this small project to make the code reusable

### Given more time, what would you have done differently?

I was learning test using jest library which seems to be quite difficult. if I were given more time i will be able to learn jest and use it more efficiently in the project.

### Problems

The apis are very simple which only gets all list of albums, users and photos i had to use filter methods to filter out albums based on selected user and images bsed on selected album.
